## Most Recent SpaceX Launch [1] [1]

The most recent major SpaceX launch was NASA's Crew-11 mission to the International Space Station (ISS), which launched on August 1, 2025. This mission carried four people to the ISS: two U.S. astronauts, one Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut. [1] They will be aboard the International Space Station for six months conducting research.

### Crew-11 Details

The Crew-11 mission crew consists of:
- NASA astronaut and mission commander Zena Cardman
- NASA astronaut Mike Fincke
- JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) astronaut Kimiya Yui
- Roscosmos cosmonaut [1] Oleg Platonov

This crew will live and work aboard the International Space Station for at least six months.

The launch took place just before noon on Friday, August 1, 2025, from Florida. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launched from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39-A, carrying the Dragon capsule and crew on a nine-minute trip from Earth's surface into [2] orbit. It took the crew about 15 hours to reach the ISS, with docking planned for Saturday, August 3, around 3 a.m. ET.

Weather had threatened to delay the Crew-11 mission for a second time, but the launch team [1] was able to "thread the clouds" to successfully launch the four-person crew.

### Science Missions

During their six-month stay on the ISS, the Crew-11 astronauts will be conducting dozens of science experiments. These include studying plant cell division and mic [2]rogravity's effects on bacterial-killing viruses. They'll also perform experiments to produce a "higher volume of human stem cells and general on-demand nutrients."

## Other Recent SpaceX Activity

SpaceX recently marked its 450th flight-proven Falcon booster launch [3] on August 3, 2025.

So far in 2025, SpaceX has launched 96 rockets: 94 Falcon 9s, zero Falcon Heavies, and two Starships. (Note that Starship launches are not included in their standard success and launch rates). Of these missions, 26 have been non-Starlink missions. [4]

## Upcoming SpaceX Launches

An upcoming SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will launch 24 Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit. The first stage booster (tail number B1088) will be launching for the ninth time and is scheduled to land on the droneship "Of Course I Still Love You," positioned in the Pacific Ocean. [5] [4] This launch was delayed from August 2/3.

SpaceX has launches scheduled for:
- Thursday, August 7, 2025, at 14:01 UTC from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral SFS, Florida
- Sunday, August 10, 2025, at 02:05 UTC from SLC-4E, Vandenberg SFB, California

Another upcoming mission will involve a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launching a Cargo Dragon spacecraft with supplies and science equipment to the International Space Station. This Dragon mission will include a new propulsion system within the vehicle's trunk that will allow it to perform a boost of the space station's orbit. This is a significant milestone in SpaceX's development of the ISS Deorbit Vehicle, which will help [3] slowly lower the orbit of the space station at the end of its functional life around 2030/2031.

## 2025 SpaceX Launch Goals

SpaceX is aiming to break records in 2025 with plans for 175 to 180 launches for the year - just for Falcon rockets. This could also be Starship's biggest year yet, potentially becoming an operational rocket by the end of the year. [3]

SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell stated that SpaceX is hoping for 175 to 180 Falcon 9 launches this year. While they may not meet this exact goal, they will likely get close with an estimated 160 to 170 launches, coming from an increase in launches from both East and West coasts.
