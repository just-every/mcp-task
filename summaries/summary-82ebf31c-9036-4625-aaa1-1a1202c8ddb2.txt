The latest major SpaceX launch was the NASA Crew-11 mission to the International Space Station (ISS), which launched successfully on August 1, 2025. This mission carried four crew members—two NASA astronauts, one JAXA astronaut, and one Roscosmos cosmonaut—aboard a Falcon 9 rocket launched from Kennedy Space Center. The crew will stay for six months conducting diverse scientific research on the ISS.

In addition, SpaceX has conducted 96 total launches so far in 2025, primarily Falcon 9 missions, with plans to reach around 175 to 180 Falcon 9 launches by year's end. Upcoming launches include another Falcon 9 carrying 24 Starlink satellites (scheduled for August 7, 2025), and a Cargo Dragon mission to the ISS featuring a new orbital boost capability.

SpaceX’s recent milestones include the 450th flight of their flight-proven Falcon booster on August 3, 2025, and advancing technologies for ISS orbit maintenance and future deorbiting. Overall, SpaceX continues to ramp up its launch cadence and technology development through 2025.
